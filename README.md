# In the TODO LIST project, I used React, TypeScript and SCSS.
  Todo list - [DEMO LINK](https://ohiiko.github.io/react_todo-app/)


# About project:
- in this API, after registering, you can `create`, `read`, `update` and `delete` (`CRUD`) Todo;
- all actions interact with the server (`Get`, `Post`, `Delete`, `Patch`). While waiting for a response from the server, temporary elements are created that display the Loader;
- filter todos by status `All` / `Active` / `Completed`;
- delete all completed `Clear completed`, if there are no completed, the button is hidden;
- toggle the status Todo;
- toggle the status of all todos to active or completed;
- displays the number of all active todos;
- In case of any `error`, a notification is displayed with the corresponding message at the bottom. The notification can be closed with the close button or automatically hidden after 3 seconds;
